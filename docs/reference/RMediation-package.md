# RMediation: Mediation Analysis Confidence Intervals

Computes confidence intervals for nonlinear functions of model
parameters (e.g., product of k coefficients) in single-level and
multilevel structural equation models. Methods include the distribution
of the product, Monte Carlo simulation, and bootstrap methods. It also
performs the Model-Based Constrained Optimization (MBCO) procedure for
hypothesis testing of indirect effects. References: Tofighi, D., and
