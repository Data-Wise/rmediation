# RMediation rhub Debug Report — 2026-06-19

## Final Verdict: RESOLVED (with one expected failure) ✅

Run **major-viceroybutterfly** (run 27854572331, main branch, v1.5.0): -
`ubuntu-clang`: ✅ - `ubuntu-gcc12`: ✅ - `nosuggests`: ❌ — EXPECTED
(documented; see below) - `gcc-asan`: ⏳ in progress (expected ✅ based
on gcc-asan pass on turtleshelled-stagbeetle)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Failure 1 — clang-asan: RcppParallel ODR violation (RESOLVED by platform switch)

**Run:** consolable-chickadee

**Symptom:** ASAN failure at dependency-installation step, before any
RMediation code ran.

**Root cause:** `RcppParallel` 5.1.11-2 (transitive dependency via
`lavaan`) bundles TBB shared libraries (`libtbb.so.2`,
`libtbbmalloc.so.2`). Under clang-ASAN these trigger a
One-Definition-Rule (ODR) violation — two copies of the same symbol
loaded from different `.so` paths. This is a known upstream bug in
`RcppParallel` under ASAN.

**Fix:** Switched from `clang-asan` to `gcc-asan` (Fedora 42 with GCC).
The ODR violation does not manifest under GCC’s ASAN implementation.
`gcc-asan` passed on turtleshelled-stagbeetle and is expected to pass on
major-viceroybutterfly.

**CRAN implication:** CRAN’s ASAN checks use their own infrastructure
(typically Debian with clang). If they hit the same RcppParallel ODR, it
would surface as a NOTE/WARNING on a transitive dependency’s check, not
on RMediation’s check. No code change needed in RMediation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Failure 2 — nosuggests: Vignette rebuild (EXPECTED, documented)

**All runs:** Expected failure on every run.

**Symptom:** `run-check@v1` fails (not an infrastructure step — the full
R CMD check runs but fails during vignette rebuilding).

**Root cause:** The `nosuggests` container does not install packages
listed in `Suggests`. RMediation has `VignetteBuilder: knitr` and
`rmarkdown` in `Suggests`. Without `rmarkdown`, vignette rebuilding
fails with a “package not found” error. This is by design in the
nosuggests container.

**Why this is NOT a CRAN problem:** CRAN installs `Suggests` packages
when building vignettes on their servers. The failure only occurs in the
deliberately stripped nosuggests environment. The two passing Linux
containers (ubuntu-clang, ubuntu-gcc12) rebuild vignettes successfully.

**Fix:** None required. Documented in `cran-comments.md`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### pak devel regression (AVOIDED by pak-version: stable)

**Run:** turtleshelled-stagbeetle and major-viceroybutterfly both use
`pak-version: stable` in `rhub.yaml` — added after diagnosing the same
regression that affected medrobust. RMediation had no renv artifacts, so
Layer 2 and Layer 3 of medrobust’s failure chain did not apply here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Files Changed

| Commit | Files | Change |
|----|----|----|
| 5f9be98 | `.github/workflows/rhub.yaml` | Add `pak-version: stable` to both setup-deps blocks |
| (prior session) | `cran-comments.md` | Document nosuggests + clang-asan failures with explanations |
