# Memory Experiment Data Description from MacKinnon et al., 2018

Data were obtained from eight replicated experiments. The data were
collected on the first day of class as part of the first Dr. MacKinnon's
(2018) classroom teaching. The pedagogical value of the experiment was
that students would have first-hand knowledge of the experiment thereby
increasing their understanding of course concepts. Permission to use the
data was obtained from the university Institutional Review Board.
