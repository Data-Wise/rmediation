**RMediation** provides rigorous statistical methods for mediation
analysis in observational and experimental designs. It addresses the
known limitations of normal-theory confidence intervals (e.g., Sobel
test) by implementing advanced methods that account for the non-normal
distribution of the indirect effect.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Rigorous Confidence Intervals

Compute accurate Confidence Intervals (CIs) for indirect effects using
methods that outperform the standard normal approximation:

- **Distribution of the Product:** Exact method for the product of two
  normal random variables.
- **Monte Carlo Method:** Robust simulation-based intervals.
- **Bootstrapping:** Parametric and semi-parametric bootstrap
  implementations.

### 2. Advanced Hypothesis Testing

- **LRT-MBCO:** Implements the **Likelihood Ratio Test via Model-Based
  Constrained Optimization**, a powerful frequentist method for testing
  indirect effects that controls Type I error rates better than standard
  approaches.
- **Sobel Test:** Asymptotic normal test included for baseline
  comparison.

### 3. Seamless Integration

- Works directly with summary statistics (coefficients/SEs).
- Extracts parameters automatically from fitted `lavaan` or `OpenMx`
  model objects.

## Installation

You can install the stable version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("RMediation")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

R

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("data-wise/RMediation")

## Usage

### Using Summary Statistics to Calculate CIs

If you already have estimates from a published paper or other software,
you can calculate CIs using coefficients ($\widehat{a},\widehat{b}$) and
their standard errors.

``` r
library(RMediation)

# Example: Single mediator
# a = 0.5, b = 0.6, se.a = 0.08, se.b = 0.04, rho = 0 (independence)
medci(mu.x = 0.5, mu.y = 0.6, se.x = 0.08, se.y = 0.04, rho = 0, type = "prodclin")
```

### Using `ci` to Calculate CIs for Indirect Effects of Path with Two Sequential Mediators

``` r
library(RMediation)

# Example: Two sequential mediators
ci(mu = c(b1 = 1, b2 = .7, b3 = .6, b4 = .45),
  Sigma = c(.05, 0, 0, 0, .05, 0, 0, .03, 0, .03),
  quant = ~ b1 * b2 * b3 * b4, type = "MC", plot = TRUE, plotCI = TRUE)
```
