## Overview

**RMediation** computes confidence intervals for indirect effects in mediation analysis. It implements statistically rigorous methods that account for the non-normal distribution of the product of regression coefficients—addressing the well-known limitations of normal-theory approaches like the Sobel test.

The package supports:

- **Single mediator models** (X → M → Y)
- **Sequential/serial mediators** (X → M₁ → M₂ → Y)
- **Parallel mediators** with complex indirect effects
- **Any product of normal random variables** for custom applications

## Why RMediation?

Traditional methods (e.g., Sobel test) assume the indirect effect *ab* follows a normal distribution. This assumption is often violated because the product of two normal variables is *not* normally distributed—especially when effect sizes are small or sample sizes are modest.

**RMediation** provides methods that correctly handle this non-normality:

| Method | Best For | Speed |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **DOP** (Distribution of Product) | Two-variable products; publication-quality results | Fast |
| **Monte Carlo** | Complex models; 3+ variable products | Moderate |
| **MBCO** (Model-Based Constrained Optimization) | Hypothesis testing; bootstrap inference | Slower |

## Installation

### From CRAN (Stable)

```r
install.packages("RMediation")
```

### From GitHub (Development)

```r
# Using pak (recommended)
pak::pak("Data-Wise/rmediation@develop")

# Or using remotes
remotes::install_github("Data-Wise/rmediation", ref = "develop")
```

## Usage

### Basic Example: Single Mediator

When you have coefficient estimates and standard errors (e.g., from a published study):

```r
library(RMediation)

# Path coefficients: a = 0.5 (SE = 0.08), b = 0.6 (SE = 0.04)
# Compute 95% CI for the indirect effect ab
medci(mu.x = 0.5, mu.y = 0.6,
      se.x = 0.08, se.y = 0.04,
      rho = 0, type = "dop")

#> 95% CI for ab: [0.178, 0.422]
#> Estimate: 0.300, SE: 0.062
```

### Sequential Mediators (3+ Variables)

For models with multiple sequential mediators (X → M₁ → M₂ → Y), use the `ci()` function with a formula:

```r
# Four-path indirect effect: b1 * b2 * b3 * b4
ci(mu = c(b1 = 1.0, b2 = 0.7, b3 = 0.6, b4 = 0.45),
   Sigma = c(0.05, 0, 0, 0,    # Covariance matrix (lower triangle)
             0.05, 0, 0,
             0.03, 0,
             0.03),
   quant = ~ b1 * b2 * b3 * b4,
   type = "MC",
   n.mc = 1e5)
```

### With lavaan Models

RMediation integrates directly with [lavaan](https://lavaan.ugent.be/) SEM models:

```r
library(lavaan)
library(RMediation)

# Define mediation model with labeled paths
model <- '
  m ~ a*x
  y ~ b*m + c*x

  # Define indirect effect
  ab := a*b
'

fit <- sem(model, data = mydata)

# Compute CI for indirect effect (auto-detects 'ab := a*b')
ci(fit, type = "dop")
```

### Using the S7 ProductNormal Class

For programmatic use, create `ProductNormal` objects directly:

```r
# Define distribution of two correlated normal variables
pn <- ProductNormal(
  mu = c(0.5, 0.3),
  Sigma = matrix(c(0.01, 0.002,
                   0.002, 0.01), 2, 2)
)

# Compute confidence interval
ci(pn, level = 0.95, type = "dop")

# Get CDF and quantiles
cdf(pn, q = 0.15)
dist_quantile(pn, p = 0.975)

# View summary
summary(pn)
```

### Hypothesis Testing with MBCO

For formal hypothesis testing of indirect effects using bootstrap:

```r
# Requires OpenMx model
library(OpenMx)

# ... define your OpenMx mediation model ...

# Run MBCO test (H0: indirect effect = 0)
mbco(model, effect = "ab", n.boot = 1000, type = "parametric")
```
