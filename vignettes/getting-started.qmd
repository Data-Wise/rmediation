## Introduction

The RMediation package provides rigorous statistical methods for mediation analysis in observational and experimental designs. It addresses the known limitations of normal-theory confidence intervals (e.g., Sobel test) by implementing advanced methods that account for the non-normal distribution of the indirect effect.

## Basic Usage

### Single Mediator Analysis

To compute a confidence interval for a single mediator using summary statistics:

```{r}
#| label: example1

# Example: Single mediator with known coefficients and standard errors
result <- medci(
  mu.x = 0.5,  # Effect of X on M
  mu.y = 0.6,  # Effect of M on Y (controlling for X)  
  se.x = 0.08, # Standard error of a path
  se.y = 0.04, # Standard error of b path
  rho = 0,     # Correlation between a and b (often 0 for experimental X)
  type = "dop" # Distribution of the product method
)

# Display the structure of the result
str(result)

# Or access specific components
cat("Confidence Interval:", result$`95% CI`, "\n")
cat("Estimate:", result$Estimate, "\n")
cat("Standard Error:", result$SE, "\n")
```

### Multiple Mediators

For more complex mediation models with multiple mediators:

```{r}
#| label: example2

# Example: Two sequential mediators
result2 <- ci(
  mu = c(b1 = 1, b2 = .7, b3 = .6, b4 = .45),
  Sigma = c(.05, 0, 0, 0, .05, 0, 0, .03, 0, .03),
  quant = ~ b1 * b2 * b3 * b4, 
  type = "MC",
  plot = FALSE  # Set to TRUE to see visualization
)

str(result2)
```

### Using S7 Classes

The package includes modern S7 object-oriented classes:

```{r}
#| label: example3

# Create a ProductNormal distribution object
pn <- ProductNormal(
  mu = c(0.5, 0.3),  # Means of the two normal variables
  Sigma = matrix(c(0.01, 0.002, 0.002, 0.01), 2, 2)  # Covariance matrix
)

# Compute confidence interval
ci_result <- ci(pn, level = 0.95)

show(pn)  # Use show instead of print
str(ci_result)  # Use str to show structure
```

## Available Methods

RMediation offers several methods for computing confidence intervals:

- `"dop"`: Distribution of the product (default for medci)
- `"MC"`: Monte Carlo method
- `"asymp"`: Asymptotic normal approach
- `"all"`: All methods

```{r}
#| label: methods

# Compare different methods
comparison <- medci(
  mu.x = 0.5, mu.y = 0.6, se.x = 0.08, se.y = 0.04, rho = 0,
  type = "all", plot = FALSE
)

# Show comparison
str(comparison)
```

## Integration with Structural Equation Modeling

RMediation integrates seamlessly with popular SEM packages:

```{r}
#| label: lavaan-integration
#| eval: false

library(lavaan)

# Define a simple mediation model
model <- '
  # Direct effect
  Y ~ c*X
  
  # Mediator
  M ~ a*X
  Y ~ b*M
  
  # Indirect effect
  ab := a*b
  # Total effect
  total := c + (a*b)
'

# This would be fitted with your data
# fit <- sem(model, data = your_data)

# Automatically compute CI for defined parameters
# result <- ci(fit)  # This would auto-detect 'ab' parameter
```

## Validation and Error Handling

The package includes robust validation for inputs:

```{r}
#| label: validation
#| eval: false

# These would throw helpful error messages:
# medci(mu.x = 0.5, mu.y = 0.6, se.x = -0.1, se.y = 0.04)  # Invalid negative SE
# ci(mu = c(0.5), Sigma = matrix(1), quant = ~ b1)  # Dimension mismatch
```

## Conclusion

RMediation provides a comprehensive solution for mediation analysis with proper statistical inference. The package offers multiple methods for computing confidence intervals, seamless SEM integration, and robust error handling.
