**RMediation** provides rigorous statistical methods for mediation
analysis in observational and experimental designs. It addresses the
known limitations of normal-theory confidence intervals (e.g., Sobel
test) by implementing advanced methods that account for the non-normal
distribution of the indirect effect.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Rigorous Confidence Intervals

Compute accurate Confidence Intervals (CIs) for indirect effects using
methods that outperform the standard normal approximation:

- **Distribution of the Product:** Exact method for the product of two
  normal random variables.
- **Monte Carlo Method:** Robust simulation-based intervals.
- **Bootstrapping:** Parametric and semi-parametric bootstrap
  implementations.

### 2. Advanced Hypothesis Testing

- **LRT-MBCO:** Implements the **Likelihood Ratio Test via Model-Based
  Constrained Optimization**, a powerful frequentist method for testing
  indirect effects that controls Type I error rates better than standard
  approaches.
- **Sobel Test:** Asymptotic normal test included for baseline
  comparison.

### 3. Seamless Integration

- Works directly with summary statistics (coefficients/SEs).
- Extracts parameters automatically from fitted `lavaan` or `OpenMx`
  model objects.

## Installation

You can install the stable version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("RMediation")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

R

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("data-wise/RMediation")

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario A: Using Summary Statistics

If you already have estimates from a published paper or other software,
you can calculate CIs using coefficients ($\widehat{a},\widehat{b}$) and
their standard errors.

``` r
library(RMediation)

# Example: Single mediator
# a = 0.5, b = 0.6, se.a = 0.08, se.b = 0.04, rho = 0 (independence)
medci(mu.x = 0.5, mu.y = 0.6, se.x = 0.08, se.y = 0.04, rho = 0, type = "prodclin")
```

### Scenario B: Using a Fitted Model Object (Lavaan)

If you have fit a model using `lavaan`, `RMediation` can automatically
extract the necessary information to compute CIs for indirect effects.

``` r
library(lavaan)
library(RMediation)

# 1. Fit your model in lavaan
fit <- sem(my_model, data = my_data)

# 2. Pass the fitted object directly to ci()
# RMediation detects the coefficients and covariance matrix automatically
results <- ci(fit, type = "MC") 
print(results)
```
