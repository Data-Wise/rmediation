\usage{
is_fit(model,...)

\S4method{is_fit}{ANY}(model, ...)

\S4method{is_fit}{lavaan}(model, ...)

\S4method{is_fit}{MxModel}(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A lavaan object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments affecting the method dispatched
(currently not used but available for future extensions).}
}
\value{
A logical value: \code{TRUE} if the model has been fitted, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
This function checks whether a structural equation modeling (SEM) model,
represented by either a \code{lavaan} object or an \code{MxModel} object from the \code{OpenMx}
package, has been fitted. The function offers a convenient way to programmatically
verify if the model fitting step has been executed for a given model object.

Method for ANY object. This method returns \code{FALSE} for any object that is not
a \code{lavaan} or \code{MxModel} object.

Method for lavaan objects. This method checks the \code{do.fit} option in the
\code{lavaan} object to determine if the model has been fitted. If the \code{do.fit}
option is \code{TRUE}, the model has been fitted; otherwise, it has not been fitted.

Method for OpenMx objects. This method checks the \code{wasRun} slot in the
\code{MxModel} object to determine if the model has been fitted. If the \code{wasRun}
slot is \code{TRUE}, the model has been fitted; otherwise, it has not been fitted.

# Assuming 'mx_model' is an OpenMx model object

# Checking the output
